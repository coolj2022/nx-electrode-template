## Adding a new SubApp using workspace-generator
Let's say you have a new subApp generated by the `create-subapp` called `demo`

1. You need to add it to [package.json](package.json) as dependency

```
"demo": "*",
```

2. Import the subApp (and reducers if you need the redux feature) in the `index.tsx` file in [/src/layout/](./src/layout/index.tsx)

```javascript
import { subApp as demoSubApp, reducers as demoReducers } from 'demo';
```

3. In the same file create the Electrode dynamic component

```javascript
const Demo = createDynamicComponent(demoSubApp, { ssr: false });
```

4. And add it as a route under the additional routes section, as example:

```javascript
<Switch>
  ...
  {/* define additional routes here */}
  <Route path='/demo'>
    <Demo />
  </Route>
</Switch>
```

5. And add subapp reducers to the root reducer, as example:

```javascript
export const reduxReducers = Object.assign({},
  libReducers,
  demoReducers,
);
```

6. And if you want to add this as a menu item, you can add it in the `menu.json` file in [/src/common/](./src/common/menu.json), as example:
```javascript
      ...
			{
				"name": "Sample Apps",
				"icon": "Flash",
				"children": [
					...
					{
						"name": "Demo",
						"url": "/demo"
					}
				]
			}
      ...
```

7. Don't forget to run `yarn install` in the root of the monorepo.
